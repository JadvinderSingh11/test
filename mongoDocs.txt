Mongo Database 
Data in the mongo is just a document or in simple words it is a object which is contains key and values where every key responds to a value assigned.
For Instance :
 Data = { name : “Jadvinder Singh”, About : “Kujj shikte rehna hai”}

	values
keys

Now to create serve on your computer:
First we need download Mongo community serve and along with that we have install mongosh ( mongo shell ).
After, just declare the environmental variable in the system variables under the path section.
Now just 	 CMD.

Here are some commands to start with:
Show dbs – This command shows all the created database.

How to perform CRUD( Create, Read, Update, and Delete ) – 
Create – while creating a database in the mongo we have to run the command
	Use <name of the database>
Then, insert operations – 
	Insert one – db.<collection name>.insertOne({ document})
	Insert many - db.<collection name>.insertMany([{ document1},{document2}])
Read – just run find command
	db.<collection name>.find({}) – for fetching all the documents.
db.<collection name>.find({<key>:<value>}) – for fetching one the document.

Find function in Mongo db-
Db.<collection>.find({ <key> : {$lt: <value>}) – Where we need to find values less than a particular value.
Db.<collection>.find({ <key> : {$gt: <value>}) – Where we need to find values greater than a particular value.
 Arrays in querries –
	Find a array with same order-
	db.inventory.find( { <key>: ["value1", "value2"] } )
	Find all the elements with these elements in any order-
	db.inventory.find( { <key>: { $all: ["value1", "value2"] } } )
	Finding between a range-
	db.inventory.find( { <key>: { $gt: 15, $lt: 20 } } )
	Find any element in an array in that particular range - 
db.inventory.find( { <key>: { $elemMatch: { $gt: 22, $lt: 30 } } } )
