Learning Code

To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin Bostoncream - This is the command useful for upstreaming the branches to the remote respository (This is very important)

    git checkout main - This is for checkout in between of Main and branches

    git pull origin main - This command is very useful and best practice before pushing any information from branches

    git merge Bostoncream - This command is very useful for merging the branch with the checked out Branch or main

    git commit -m " Merge BostonCream into main" - This command is for just commit

    git push origin main - This command is very useful for pushing the local files into remote repository.
